3. **Data Transmission**: Data is split into packets, sent across the network, and reassembled at the destination.

4. **Switches & Routers**: Switches link devices within a network; routers direct data between networks.

5. **Addressing**: Each device has a unique IP address to ensure data reaches the correct destination.

6. **Network Services**: DNS translates domain names to IP addresses; DHCP assigns IP addresses automatically.

7. **Data Handling**: The receiving device processes and reassembles data packets to complete communication.

# How is computer networking evolving?

1. **5G & Beyond**: Faster, more reliable wireless networks are expanding connectivity and enabling new applications like autonomous vehicles and smart cities.

2. **IoT Growth**: The Internet of Things is connecting billions of devices, from household gadgets to industrial sensors, increasing the complexity and scale of networks.

3. **Edge Computing**: Processing data closer to where it's generated reduces latency and bandwidth usage, making networks more efficient.

4. **AI & Automation**: Artificial intelligence is being used to automate network management, optimize performance, and enhance security.

5. **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**: SDN separates the control and data planes, allowing for more flexible, programmable networks that can adapt to changing needs.

6. **Cybersecurity**: As networks grow and become more complex, new security measures are being developed to protect against increasingly sophisticated threats.

7. **Quantum Networking**: Research in quantum computing is laying the groundwork for quantum networks, which promise ultra-secure communication and faster data processing.

8. **Cloud Networking**: The shift to cloud-based services is changing how networks are structured, emphasizing scalability, flexibility, and remote access.

These advancements are driving more interconnected, intelligent, and secure networks.
