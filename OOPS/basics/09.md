| Feature                | Abstract Class                                          | Interface                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Declaration**        | Declared with `abstract` keyword.                        | Declared with `interface` keyword.                        |
| **Instantiation**      | Cannot be instantiated directly.                         | Cannot be instantiated directly.                         |
| **Methods**            | Can have abstract methods (no body) and concrete methods (with body). | Only method signatures (names, parameters, return types), no method bodies. |
| **Variables**          | Can have instance variables.                             | Cannot have instance variables (except constants in Java 8+). |
| **Implementation**     | Used to provide a partial implementation, allowing some methods to be abstract (to be overridden) and others to be concrete (inherited as-is). | Defines a contract for classes to implement specific methods, ensuring adherence to a certain behavior. |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | A class can extend only one abstract class (single inheritance). | A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance of type). |
| **Keyword**            | `abstract class ClassName { ... }`                       | `interface InterfaceName { ... }`                         |
| **Usage**              | Used when sharing code among related classes and providing default behavior that subclasses can extend or override. | Used when defining a set of methods that classes must implement, allowing for polymorphism and code flexibility. |
