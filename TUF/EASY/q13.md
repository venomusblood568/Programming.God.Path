# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length;i++){
            if(prices[i] < buy){
                buy = prices[i];
            }
            else if(prices[i] - buy > profit){
                profit = prices[i] - buy;

        }
        return profit;
    }
}

This condition ensures that you are always keeping track of the highest possible profit you can achieve as you iterate through the list of prices.

Here's a recap:

Condition Check: else if(prices[i] - buy > profit)

It checks if the profit from selling at the current price (i.e., prices[i]) minus the lowest price you have encountered so far (i.e., buy) is greater than the current maximum profit (profit).
Update Profit: profit = prices[i] - buy;

If the condition is true, it means you have found a higher profit than previously recorded. The profit variable is then updated to this new higher value.
By the end of the iteration through the prices list, profit will contain the highest possible profit that can be achieved from a single buy-sell transaction.
